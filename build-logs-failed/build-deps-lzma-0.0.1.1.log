Resolving dependencies...
Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: lzma-0.0.1.1 (user goal)
[__1] trying: lzma:*test
[__2] next goal: tasty-quickcheck (dependency of lzma *test)
[__2] rejecting: tasty-quickcheck; 0.11, 0.10.3

[__2] fail (backjumping, conflict set: lzma, tasty-quickcheck, lzma:test)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: tasty-quickcheck, lzma, lzma:test
