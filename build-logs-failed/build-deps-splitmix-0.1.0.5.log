Resolving dependencies...
Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: splitmix-0.1.0.5 (user goal)
[__1] trying: splitmix:*test
[__2] next goal: random (dependency of splitmix *test)
[__2] rejecting: random-1.2.1.2 (cyclic dependencies; conflict set: random, splitmix)
[__2] rejecting: random; 1.2.1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.0, 1.1, 1.0.1.1, 1.0.1.0, 1.0.0.3, 1.0.0.2, 1.0.0.1, 1.0.0.0, 1.0.1.3
      (constraint from /tmp/fully-pinned-cabal2940376-0.config requires ==1.2.1.2)
        imported by: cabal.project.local
[__2] fail (backjumping, conflict set: random, splitmix, splitmix:test)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: random, splitmix, splitmix:test
