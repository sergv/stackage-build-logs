[1 of 8] Compiling Data.HSet.Type

src/Data/HSet/Type.hs:17:22: warning: [GHC-39567] [-Wstar-is-type]
    Using ‘*’ (or its Unicode variant) to mean ‘Data.Kind.Type’
    relies on the StarIsType extension, which will become
    deprecated in the future.
    Suggested fix: Use ‘Type’ from ‘Data.Kind’ instead.
