src/Sound/Audacity/LabelTrack.hs:47:4: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances]
    Noncanonical ‘mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monoid (T time label)’.
    ‘mappend’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘(<>)’
    Either remove definition for ‘mappend’ (recommended) or define as ‘mappend = (<>)’
