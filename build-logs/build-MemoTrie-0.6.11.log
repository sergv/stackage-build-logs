src/Data/MemoTrie.hs:91:22: warning: [GHC-39567] [-Wstar-is-type]
    Using ‘*’ (or its Unicode variant) to mean ‘Data.Kind.Type’
    relies on the StarIsType extension, which will become
    deprecated in the future.
    Suggested fix: Use ‘Type’ from ‘Data.Kind’ instead.

src/Data/MemoTrie.hs:604:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monad-instances]
    Noncanonical ‘return’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monad ((:->:) a)’.
    ‘return’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘pure’
    Either remove definition for ‘return’ (recommended) or define as ‘return = pure’
