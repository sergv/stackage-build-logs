src/Data/Redis/Command.hs:250:1: warning: [-Wunused-imports]
    The import of ‘Data.Semigroup’ is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from ‘Data.Semigroup’
    To import instances alone, use: import Data.Semigroup()

250 | import Data.Semigroup (Semigroup, (<>))

src/Data/Redis/Command.hs:278:17: warning: [GHC-39567] [-Wstar-is-type]
    Using ‘*’ (or its Unicode variant) to mean ‘Data.Kind.Type’
    relies on the StarIsType extension, which will become
    deprecated in the future.
    Suggested fix: Use ‘Type’ from ‘Data.Kind’ instead.
