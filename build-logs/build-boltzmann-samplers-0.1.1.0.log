src/Boltzmann/Solver.hs:46:35: warning: [GHC-58520] [-Wtype-equality-requires-operators]
    The use of ‘~’ without TypeOperators
    will become an error in a future GHC release.
    Suggested fix: Perhaps you intended to use TypeOperators

src/Boltzmann/Species.hs:43:20: warning: [GHC-39567] [-Wstar-is-type]
    Using ‘*’ (or its Unicode variant) to mean ‘Data.Kind.Type’
    relies on the StarIsType extension, which will become
    deprecated in the future.
    Suggested fix: Use ‘Type’ from ‘Data.Kind’ instead.
