src/Network/CGI/Monad.hs:64:5: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monad-instances]
    Noncanonical ‘return’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monad (CGIT m)’.
    ‘return’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘pure’
    Either remove definition for ‘return’ (recommended) or define as ‘return = pure’
