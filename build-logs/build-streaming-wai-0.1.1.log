[1 of 1] Compiling Network.Wai.Streaming

src/Network/Wai/Streaming.hs:33:18: warning: [GHC-68441] [-Wdeprecations]
    In the use of ‘requestBody’
    (imported from Network.Wai, but defined in Network.Wai.Internal):
    Deprecated: "requestBody's name is misleading because it only gets a partial chunk of the body. Use getRequestBodyChunk instead when getting the field, and setRequestBodyChunks when setting the field."
