Graphics/Gloss/Internals/Data/Picture.hs:122:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances]
    Noncanonical ‘mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monoid Picture’.
    ‘mappend’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘(<>)’
    Either remove definition for ‘mappend’ (recommended) or define as ‘mappend = (<>)’
