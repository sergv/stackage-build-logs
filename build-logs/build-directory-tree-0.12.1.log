Test.hs:7:1: warning: [-Wunused-imports]
    The import of ‘Control.Applicative’ is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from ‘Control.Applicative’
    To import instances alone, use: import Control.Applicative()

Test.hs:30:51: warning: [GHC-47082] [-Woperator-whitespace-ext-conflict]
    The prefix use of a ‘$’ would denote an untyped splice
      were the TemplateHaskell extension enabled.
    Suggested fix: Add whitespace after the ‘$’.
