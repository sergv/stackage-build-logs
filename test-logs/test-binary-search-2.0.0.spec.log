Pure
  Integer search
    finds n when search for (>= n) [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
    finds (max l n) when search for (>= n) in range (>= l) [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
    finds n when search for (>=n) in range (<=h), iff n <= h. [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  Range search
    returns Nothing for always failing predicate. [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
    finds n given that n is within the range. [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  Bounded search
    always finds n when searched for (>=n), by default. [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
    fails when given always failing predicate. [✔]
    finds the lower bound when given an always-holding predicate. [✔]
    finds (max l n) for lower-bounded search. [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
    finds Nothing for always-failing predicate with a bound. [✔]
      +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
    finds n for upper-bounded search, iff n is within the bound. [✔]
