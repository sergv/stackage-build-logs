ChangeState test
This example simulates what happens when you modify your state type
without telling AcidState how to migrate from the old version to the new.
Hopefully this program will fail with a readable error message.

Caught error: Could not parse saved checkpoint due to the following error: too few bytes
From:	ChangeState.SecondState:
	demandInput


ChangeState done
ChangeVersion test
This example simulates what happens when you modify your safecopy
version without specifying how to migrate from the old version to the new.
Hopefully this program will fail with a readable error message.

Caught error: Could not parse saved checkpoint due to the following error: Failed reading: safecopy: ChangeVersion.SecondState: Cannot find getter associated with this version number: Version {unVersion = 0}
Empty call stack

ChangeVersion done

RemoveEvent test
This example simulates what happens when you remove an event
that is required to replay the journal.
Hopefully this program will fail with a readable error message.

Caught error: Data.Acid.Core: This method is required but not available: "RemoveEvent.FirstEvent". Did you perhaps remove it before creating a checkpoint?
RemoveEvent done
SlowCheckpoint test
This example illustrates that the state is still accessible while
a checkpoint is being serialized. This is an important property when
the size of a checkpoint reaches several hundred megabytes.
If you don't see any ticks while the checkpoint is being created, something
has gone awry.
