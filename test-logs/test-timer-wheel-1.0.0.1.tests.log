timer wheel runs scheduled actions
timers can be canceled
successful `cancel` returns true, then false
unsuccessful `cancel` returns false
recurring timers work with delay > resolution work
calling `cancel` more than once on a recurring timer is ok
`with` re-throws exception from background thread
`count` increments on `register`
`count` increments on `recurring`
`count` decrements on `cancel` (registered)
`count` decrements on `cancel` (recurring)
stress test: register 1m timers into 1k spokes, then cancel them all
