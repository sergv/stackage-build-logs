To die, to sleep--\nNo more--and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heartache, and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--\nTo sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause. There's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\n"
