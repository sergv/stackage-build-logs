In order, the following will be built (use -v for more details):
 - half-0.3.1 (test:spec) (ephemeral targets)
Preprocessing test suite 'spec' for half-0.3.1...

Half Ord instance:
  (>=) is the opposite of (<) except for NaN: [OK, passed 100 tests]
  returns False for NaN > NaN: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  returns False for NaN < NaN: [OK, passed 1 tests]
Round trip:
  should round trip properly: [OK, passed 100 tests]
  idempotence 1: [OK, passed 100 tests]
  idempotence 2: [OK, passed 100 tests]
isInfinite:
  should be equivalent to \x -> x == POS_INF || x == NEG_INF: [OK, passed 100 tests]
  should return True on POS_INF: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  should return True on NEG_INF: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  should return false on QNaN: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  should return false on SNaN: [OK, passed 1 tests]
Patterns:
  QNaN: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  SNaN: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  POS_INF: [OK, passed 1 tests]
  NEG_INF: [OK, passed 1 tests]
Native fromHalf against C version:
  for full CUShort range, both version of fromHalf should return same Float: [OK, passed 1 tests]
Native toHalf against C version:
  for selected range of Float, both version of toHalf should return same Half: [OK, passed 1 tests]
Binary:
  Binary round trip a: [OK, passed 100 tests]
  Binary round trip b: [OK, passed 100 tests]
  Binary encoding example: [OK, passed 1 tests]
