checkExpired
  agrees with nextExpires [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
nextExpires
  looks sane [✔]
cookieExpires

saveSession
  works for a complex example [✔]
invalidateIfNeeded
  does not invalidate when not changing auth ID nor explicitly requesting [✔]
  invalidates the current session when changing auth ID [✔]

  invalidates all of the user's sessions when AllSessionIdsOfLoggedUser is forced [✔]
saveSessionOnDb
  inserts new sessions when there wasn't an old one [✔]
  replaces sesssions when there was an old one [✔]

  respects the timeout resolution [✔]
decomposeSession/SessionMap
  it is sane when not finding auth key or force invalidate key [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  parses the force invalidate key [✔]

  adds (overwriting) the auth ID to the session data [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
MockStorage
  runTransactionM should be sane [✔]
  getSession should return Nothing for inexistent sessions [✔]
  deleteSession should not fail for inexistent sessions [✔]
  deleteSession should delete the session [✔]
  deleteAllSessionsOfAuthId should not fail for inexistent auth IDs [✔]
  deleteAllSessionsOfAuthId should delete the relevant sessions (but no more) [✔]
  getSession should return the contents of insertSession [✔]
