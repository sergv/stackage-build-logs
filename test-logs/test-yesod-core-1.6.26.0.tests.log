If you're a developer of this site, these tips will help you debug the issue:
- Read the Yesod.Core.Handler docs of the yesod-core package for details on CSRF protection.
- Check that your HTTP client is persisting cookies between requests, like a browser does.
- By default, the CSRF token is sent to the client in a cookie named XSRF-TOKEN.
- The server is looking for the token in the following locations:

06/Oct/2024:14:57:17 +0000 [Warn#yesod-core] A valid CSRF token wasn't present. Because the request could have been forged, it's been rejected altogether.
If you're a developer of this site, these tips will help you debug the issue:
- Read the Yesod.Core.Handler docs of the yesod-core package for details on CSRF protection.
- Check that your HTTP client is persisting cookies between requests, like a browser does.
- By default, the CSRF token is sent to the client in a cookie named XSRF-TOKEN.
- The server is looking for the token in the following locations:
  - An HTTP header named X-XSRF-TOKEN (which is not currently set)
  - A POST parameter named _token (which has the current, incorrect value: 'QxDuJATKoe7FBcDtpg0wA8c9CMm7evzmBwD76JJrfoo') @(yesod-core-1.6.26.0-inplace:Yesod.Core.Handler src/Yesod/Core/Handler.hs:1666:6)
