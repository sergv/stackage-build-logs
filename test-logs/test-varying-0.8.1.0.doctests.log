src/Control/Varying/Core.hs:221:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances]
    Noncanonical ‘mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monoid (VarT m a b)’.
    ‘mappend’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘(<>)’
    Either remove definition for ‘mappend’ (recommended) or define as ‘mappend = (<>)’

src/Control/Varying/Spline.hs:93:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monad-instances]
    Noncanonical ‘return’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monad (SplineT a b m)’.
    ‘return’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘pure’
    Either remove definition for ‘return’ (recommended) or define as ‘return = pure’
