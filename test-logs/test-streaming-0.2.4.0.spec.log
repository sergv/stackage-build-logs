slidingWindowMin
  works with a few simple cases [✔]
  produces no results with empty streams [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  behaves like a (S.map Foldable.minimum) (slidingWindow) for non-empty streams [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  behaves like identity when window size is 1 [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  produces a prefix when the stream elements are sorted [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests; 27 discarded.
slidingWindowMinBy
  prefers earlier elements when several elements compare equal [✔]
  behaves like a (S.map (Foldable.minimumBy f)) (slidingWindow) for non-empty streams [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
slidingWindowMinOn
  behaves like a (S.map (Foldable.minimumBy (comparing p))) (slidingWindow) for non-empty streams [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  does not force the projected value to WHNF [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests; 27 discarded.
slidingWindowMax
  produces no results with empty streams [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.

    +++ OK, passed 100 tests; 27 discarded.
slidingWindowMaxBy
  prefers later elements when several elements compare equal [✔]
  behaves like a (S.map (Foldable.maximumBy f)) (slidingWindow) for non-empty streams [✔]
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
slidingWindowMaxOn
