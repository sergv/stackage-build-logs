Examples of isInstanceOf:
  CANNOT use a term of type 'Int -> Bool' as 'Int -> Int': [OK]
  CAN use a term of type 'forall a. a -> Int' as 'Int -> Int': [OK]
  CAN use a term of type 'forall a b. a -> b' as 'forall a. a -> a': [OK]
  CANNOT use a term of type 'forall a. a -> a' as 'forall a b. a -> b': [OK]
  CAN use a term of type 'forall a. a' as 'forall a. a -> a': [OK]
  CANNOT use a term of type 'forall a. a -> a' as 'forall a. a': [OK]
Examples of funResultTy:
  Apply fn of type (forall a. a -> a) to arg of type Bool gives Bool: [OK]
  Apply fn of type (forall a b. a -> b -> a) to arg of type Bool gives forall a. a -> Bool: [OK]
  Apply fn of type (forall a. (Bool -> a) -> a) to argument of type (forall a. a -> a) gives Bool: [OK]
  Apply fn of type (forall a b. a -> b -> a) to arg of type (forall a. a -> a) gives (forall a b. a -> b -> b): [OK]
  Cannot apply function of type (forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a) to arg of type (Int -> Bool): [OK]
Examples of fromDynamic:
  CANNOT use a term of type 'Int -> Bool' as 'Int -> Int': [OK]
  CAN use a term of type 'forall a. a -> Int' as 'Int -> Int': [OK]
  CAN use a term of type 'forall a b. a -> b' as 'forall a. a -> a': [OK]
  CANNOT use a term of type 'forall a. a -> a' as 'forall a b. a -> b': [OK]
  CAN use a term of type 'forall a. a' as 'forall a. a -> a': [OK]
  CANNOT use a term of type 'forall a. a -> a' as 'forall a. a': [OK]
Examples of dynApply:
  Apply fn of type (forall a. a -> a) to arg of type Bool gives Bool: [OK]
  Apply fn of type (forall a b. a -> b -> a) to arg of type Bool gives forall a. a -> Bool: [OK]
  Apply fn of type (forall a. (Bool -> a) -> a) to argument of type (forall a. a -> a) gives Bool: [OK]
  Apply fn of type (forall a b. a -> b -> a) to arg of type (forall a. a -> a) gives (forall a b. a -> b -> b): [OK]
  Cannot apply function of type (forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a) to arg of type (Int -> Bool): [OK]
