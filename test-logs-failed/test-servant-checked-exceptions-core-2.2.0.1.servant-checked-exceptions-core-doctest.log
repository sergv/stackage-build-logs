Error: [Cabal-7043]
Cannot test the test suite 'servant-checked-exceptions-core-doctest' because it is marked as 'buildable: False' within the 'servant-checked-exceptions-core.cabal' file (at least for the current configuration). If you believe it should be buildable then check the .cabal file to see if the buildable property is conditional on flags. Alternatively you may simply have to edit the .cabal file to declare it as buildable and fix any resulting build problems.
