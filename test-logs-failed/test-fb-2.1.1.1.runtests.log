In order, the following will be built (use -v for more details):

Test suite runtests: RUNNING...
In order to run the tests from the 'fb' package, you need
developer access to a Facebook app.  The tests are designed
so that your app isn't going to be hurt, but we may not
create a Facebook app for this purpose and then distribute
its secret keys in the open.

Please give your app's name, id and secret on the enviroment
variables APP_NAME, APP_ID and APP_SECRET, respectively.  
For example, before running the test you could run in the shell:

  $ export APP_NAME="example"
  $ export APP_ID="458798571203498"
  $ export APP_SECRET="28a9d0fa4272a14a9287f423f90a48f2304"

Of course, these values above aren't valid and you need to
replace them with your own.

(Exiting now with a failure code.)
